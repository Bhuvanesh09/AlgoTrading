## Description

To develop an Algorithmic Trading script which uses data obtained from the web (currently using a library called Binance on Cryptocurrencies) and suggests whether or not and in what to invest / pull out of. We are to use classical measures like Exponentially Weighted Averages, Simply Weighted Averages, etc. over different timescales, and construct market indicators out of these combinations.

## Profile of Users

The app will be used by people who are working at stock / crytocurrency trading. This app is not meant for the end user, rather as a foray into the possibilities of such an approach by the company Spinlogics, therefore we are not tasked with building a User Interface. Comparative study and Evaluation of different indicators, metrics and models by Spinlogics shall be the primary goal of the project.

## Usage Model and Diagrams (if any)

The Script will be generating alerts for it's users on Telegram by messaging them directly. Both the alert and preferrably the reasoning behind the alert (Graphs / Indicators that led to the program flagging the time) with be shared with the user.
